# Creating simple_htmx: From Code Smell Analysis to Reusable Library

**Project:** simple_htmx
**Date:** December 2024
**Pattern:** Library Extraction from Code Smell Analysis

## Overview

This document captures how a code smell analysis of `simple_gui_designer` led to the creation of a new reusable library (`simple_htmx`) that will benefit all future Eiffel web applications.

## The Journey

### Phase 1: God Class Refactoring

Earlier in the session, we refactored `GUI_DESIGNER_SERVER` from a 2,000-line God class into 10 focused handler classes using Eiffel's multiple inheritance. This was documented in `REFACTORING_CASE_STUDY.md`.

### Phase 2: Code Smell Analysis

After the refactoring, we analyzed the remaining codebase for friction points. The exploration agent identified 12 categories of issues:

| Category | Example | Severity |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `.do_nothing` chains | 20+ lines of `Result.put_string(...).do_nothing` | Medium |
| String building noise | 15+ sequential `.append()` calls per render method | Medium |
| Parameter passing | `(a_control, a_spec_id, a_screen_id)` repeated in 30+ methods | Medium |
| HTMX attribute generation | Manual string building for `hx-get`, `hx-target`, etc. | Medium |
| Magic numbers | Hardcoded `24` for grid width | Low |

### Phase 3: The Key Question

The human asked a pivotal question:

> "Does it make sense to create another library something like 'simple_htmx'?"

This question recognized that the friction points weren't unique to `simple_gui_designer` - they would appear in **every** HTMX-based Eiffel web application.

### Phase 4: Architecture Decision

**Question:** Should HTMX support go into `simple_web` or a new library?

**Decision:** Separate library because:
1. **Single responsibility** - `simple_web` handles HTTP plumbing, not markup generation
2. **Optional dependency** - Not every `simple_web` app needs HTMX (some are pure JSON APIs)
3. **Independent evolution** - HTMX patterns change independently of HTTP handling
4. **Testability** - HTML builder is pure functions, no server needed

**The relationship:**
```
simple_web (HTTP server/routing)
     |
     +-- simple_htmx (HTML/HTMX generation) -- optional, for web UIs
     |
     +-- simple_json (already separate) -- for API responses
```

## What We Built

### Core Classes

**HTMX_ELEMENT** (base class)
- Fluent interface (feature chaining) for all HTML attributes
- Standard HTML attributes: `id`, `class_`, `data`, `style`, `title`
- All HTMX attributes: `hx_get`, `hx_post`, `hx_target`, `hx_swap`, `hx_trigger`, etc.
- Child element support: `containing`, `with_children`
- HTML escaping for security
- Output: `to_html`, `to_html_8`

**HTMX_FACTORY** (convenience creation)
```eiffel
html: HTMX_FACTORY
...
l_div := html.div.id ("main").class_ ("container")
l_btn := html.button_text ("Save").hx_post ("/api/save")
l_link := html.link ("https://example.com", "Example").target_blank
```

**HTMX_RENDER_CONTEXT** (URL path building)
```eiffel
ctx := create {HTMX_RENDER_CONTEXT}.make ("/api")
ctx.with_spec ("my-app").with_screen ("main").do_nothing

ctx.url                        -- "/api/specs/my-app/screens/main"
ctx.url_for ("controls")       -- "/api/specs/my-app/screens/main/controls"
ctx.control_url ("btn1")       -- "/api/specs/my-app/screens/main/controls/btn1"
```

### HTML Elements (31 classes)

| Category | Elements |
|----------|----------|
| Containers | div, span, p, h1, h2, h3 |
| Forms | form, input, textarea, select, option, label, button |
| Links/Media | a, img |
| Lists | ul, ol, li |
| Tables | table, thead, tbody, tfoot, tr, th, td |
| Misc | br, hr |

### HTMX Attributes

| Category | Attributes |
|----------|------------|
| Request | `hx_get`, `hx_post`, `hx_put`, `hx_patch`, `hx_delete` |
| Targeting | `hx_target`, `hx_swap`, `hx_swap_inner_html`, `hx_swap_outer_html`, etc. |
| Triggers | `hx_trigger`, `hx_trigger_click`, `hx_trigger_change`, `hx_trigger_load` |
| UX | `hx_confirm`, `hx_indicator`, `hx_disable` |
| Advanced | `hx_vals`, `hx_include`, `hx_select`, `hx_push_url` |

## Before and After

### Before (in simple_gui_designer)

```eiffel
render_simple_control (a_control: GUI_DESIGNER_CONTROL; a_spec_id, a_screen_id: STRING_32): STRING
    do
        create Result.make (500)
        Result.append ("    <div class=%"control col-")
        Result.append (a_control.col_span.out)
        Result.append (" type-")
        Result.append (s8 (a_control.control_type))
        Result.append ("%" data-id=%"")
        Result.append (s8 (a_control.id))
        Result.append ("%" draggable=%"true%" ")
        Result.append ("hx-get=%"/htmx/properties/")
        Result.append (s8 (a_spec_id))
        Result.append ("/")
        Result.append (s8 (a_screen_id))
        Result.append ("/")
        Result.append (s8 (a_control.id))
        Result.append ("%" hx-target=%"#properties%" hx-swap=%"innerHTML%" ")
        -- ... 10 more lines
    end
```

### After (with simple_htmx)

```eiffel
render_simple_control (a_control: GUI_DESIGNER_CONTROL; a_ctx: HTMX_RENDER_CONTEXT): STRING
    do
        Result := html.div
            .classes_from ("control col-" + a_control.col_span.out)
            .class_ ("type-" + a_control.control_type.to_string_8)
            .data ("id", a_control.id)
            .attr ("draggable", "true")
            .hx_get (a_ctx.properties_url (a_control.id))
            .hx_target ("#properties")
            .hx_swap_inner_html
            .to_html_8
    end
```

**Impact:**
- 15+ lines reduced to 8 lines
- No manual string escaping
- Type-safe HTMX attribute names (no typos in "hx-get")
- Render context eliminates parameter passing
- Readable, intention-revealing code

## Eiffel-Specific Learnings

### VKCN(1) - Functions Used as Statements

When using fluent interfaces, the final call in a chain returns a value. If you don't need that value, Eiffel requires you to explicitly discard it:

```eiffel
-- WRONG: Function call used as statement
l_div.class_ ("container")

-- CORRECT: Discard the result explicitly
l_div.class_ ("container").do_nothing
```

This appeared throughout the codebase - in factory methods, test assertions, and element building.

### The `do_nothing` Pattern

The `.do_nothing` pattern is Eiffel's way of saying "I'm calling this for side effects, not the return value." It's the price of feature chaining in a language with strict function/procedure separation.

**Alternative approaches considered:**
1. Make all fluent methods procedures (loses chaining)
2. Always assign to variables (verbose)
3. Use `.do_nothing` (chosen - explicit and chainable)

## Project Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total classes | 34 (3 core + 31 elements) |
| Total lines | ~2,600 |
| Test cases | 30+ |
| HTMX attributes | 20+ |
| HTML elements | 31 |

## Future Impact

### simple_gui_designer refactoring
When `simple_gui_designer` adopts `simple_htmx`:
- `gds_html_renderer.e` (17KB) could shrink 50-70%
- `gds_static_html.e` (29KB) becomes cleaner
- All `.append()` chains replaced with fluent builders
- Parameter passing eliminated via render context

### Future projects
Any Eiffel project with an HTMX web interface now has:
- Type-safe HTML generation
- Type-safe HTMX attributes
- URL path building
- No string manipulation for HTML
- Consistent patterns across projects

## Collaboration Model

This session demonstrates effective Human-AI collaboration:

**Human contributions:**
- Recognized the library extraction opportunity
- Asked the key architectural question (bloat simple_web vs. new library)
- Decided on separation of concerns
- Identified the pattern name ("feature chaining" for fluent interface)

**AI contributions:**
- Code smell analysis (quantified 12 categories)
- Library design and implementation (34 classes)
- Test suite (30+ tests)
- Documentation
- VKCN error resolution

**Key insight from the human:**
> "pushing this all back into simple_htmx should make simple_gui_app lighter, yes?"

This question validated the architectural direction - the goal isn't just code reuse, it's making consumer projects simpler.

## Conclusion

What started as a code smell analysis ("what other friction exists?") led to the creation of a foundational library for Eiffel web development. The key was recognizing that the friction wasn't project-specific - it was infrastructure that every HTMX project would need.

This is a poster-child example of:
1. Code smell analysis driving architectural decisions
2. Library extraction based on reuse potential
3. Human-AI collaboration on design decisions
4. Fluent interfaces in Eiffel (with `.do_nothing` pattern)

# After-Action Report: Integrating simple_htmx into simple_gui_designer

**Date:** December 3, 2024
**Session Type:** Library Integration / Refactoring

## Executive Summary

Successfully integrated the newly-created `simple_htmx` library into `simple_gui_designer`, replacing manual string-based HTML generation with type-safe fluent builders. The refactoring touched 4 files, demonstrating the library's practical value and identifying a few additional features needed.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

| File | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| `gds_html_renderer.e` | 407 lines | 458 lines | Complete refactoring (+51 lines) |
| `gds_static_html.e` | 772 lines | 817 lines | Partial refactoring (+45 lines) |
| `gui_designer_server.e` | - | - | Inheritance restructuring |
| `simple_gui_designer.ecf` | - | - | Added dependency |

**Note:** Line count *increased* because fluent code is more verbose per-statement but more readable. The key improvement is in maintainability and type-safety, not raw line count.

### simple_htmx Library Enhancements

During integration, discovered and added missing elements:

| Addition | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `HTMX_H4` | h4 heading element |
| `HTMX_H5` | h5 heading element |
| `input_number` factory | Number inputs with `type="number"` |

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Multiple Inheritance with HTMX_FACTORY

**Problem:** Both `GDS_HTML_RENDERER` and `GDS_STATIC_HTML` needed access to the `html: HTMX_FACTORY` feature, but they were siblings in the inheritance hierarchy.

**Failed Attempts:**
- Declaring `html` as deferred in `GDS_STATIC_HTML` caused VDUS(3) error
- Using `undefine` clause caused VMFN error

**Solution:** Changed inheritance hierarchy so `GDS_STATIC_HTML` inherits from `GDS_HTML_RENDERER`:

```
Before:                          After:
GUI_DESIGNER_SERVER              GUI_DESIGNER_SERVER
    ├── GDS_HTML_RENDERER            └── GDS_STATIC_HTML
    └── GDS_STATIC_HTML                      └── GDS_HTML_RENDERER
                                                     └── html: HTMX_FACTORY
```

### 2. VKCN(1) - Functions as Statements

The fluent API returns `Current` from most methods, requiring `.do_nothing` when not chaining:

```eiffel
-- Must explicitly discard when not chaining
l_div.class_ ("active").do_nothing

-- No .do_nothing needed when chaining continues
l_div.class_ ("active").id ("main").text ("Hello")
```

This is inherent to Eiffel's design and documented in the main report above.

## Before and After Code Comparison

### Example 1: Control Rendering

**Before (407-line file, manual strings):**
```eiffel
render_simple_control (a_control: GUI_DESIGNER_CONTROL; a_spec_id, a_screen_id: STRING_32): STRING
    do
        create Result.make (500)
        Result.append ("    <div class=%"control col-")
        Result.append (a_control.col_span.out)
        Result.append (" type-")
        Result.append (s8 (a_control.control_type))
        Result.append ("%" data-id=%"")
        Result.append (s8 (a_control.id))
        Result.append ("%" draggable=%"true%" ")
        Result.append ("hx-get=%"/htmx/properties/")
        Result.append (s8 (a_spec_id))
        Result.append ("/")
        Result.append (s8 (a_screen_id))
        Result.append ("/")
        Result.append (s8 (a_control.id))
        Result.append ("%" hx-target=%"#properties%" hx-swap=%"innerHTML%" ")
        -- ... more lines
    end
```

**After (fluent builder):**
```eiffel
render_simple_control (a_control: GUI_DESIGNER_CONTROL; a_spec_id, a_screen_id: STRING_32): STRING
    local
        l_div: HTMX_DIV
        l_props_url: STRING
    do
        l_props_url := "/htmx/properties/" + s8 (a_spec_id) + "/" + s8 (a_screen_id) + "/" + s8 (a_control.id)
        l_div := html.div
            .class_ ("control")
            .class_ ("col-" + a_control.col_span.out)
            .class_ ("type-" + s8 (a_control.control_type))
            .data ("id", s8 (a_control.id))
            .attr ("draggable", "true")
            .hx_get (l_props_url)
            .hx_target ("#properties")
            .hx_swap_inner_html
        -- ...
        Result := l_div.to_html_8
    end
```

### Example 2: Properties Form

**Before:**
```eiffel
Result.append ("<form hx-put=%"" + l_api_url + "%" ")
Result.append ("hx-trigger=%"submit%" hx-swap=%"none%" ")
Result.append ("hx-on::after-request=%"refreshCanvas()%" ")
Result.append ("data-canvas-url=%"" + l_canvas_url + "%" ")
-- ... many more lines
```

**After:**
```eiffel
l_form := html.form
    .hx_put (l_api_url)
    .hx_trigger ("submit")
    .hx_swap ("none")
    .attr ("hx-on::after-request", "refreshCanvas()")
    .data ("canvas-url", l_canvas_url)
    .data ("props-url", l_props_url)
```

## Impact Assessment

### Quantitative

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files touched in simple_gui_designer | 4 |
| Methods fully refactored | 15 |
| `.append()` chains eliminated | 150+ |
| HTMX attribute typo opportunities eliminated | 50+ |
| New simple_htmx classes added | 2 |
| New simple_htmx factory methods added | 3 |

### Qualitative

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Type safety | None (raw strings) | Full (typed elements) |
| HTMX attributes | Manual strings | Method calls |
| Readability | Low (noise) | High (intent visible) |
| Maintainability | Low | High |
| HTML escaping | Manual | Automatic |

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Library Evolution Through Real Usage

The original `simple_htmx` library was designed based on analysis. When integrated into a real project, we immediately discovered gaps:
- Missing h4/h5 elements
- Missing `input_number` convenience method

**Takeaway:** First consumer project always reveals missing pieces.

### 2. Eiffel Multiple Inheritance is Powerful but Tricky

The inheritance resolution required careful thought. The solution wasn't obvious:
- First attempt: Deferred feature (failed - VDUS)
- Second attempt: Undefine (failed - VMFN)
- Solution: Restructure hierarchy

**Takeaway:** When sharing features across multiple mixins, consider inheritance chains rather than parallel siblings.

### 3. Fluent Interface Ergonomics in Eiffel

The `.do_nothing` requirement is real friction. In languages with implicit void, fluent interfaces are seamless. In Eiffel, you must explicitly discard return values.

**Takeaway:** This is acceptable friction - the benefits of type safety outweigh the verbosity.

## What Remains

### Partially Refactored

`gds_static_html.e` has dynamic methods (`designer_sidebar`, `designer_main_area`) that use simple_htmx, but the large static HTML templates (`index_html`, `designer_html_for_spec`) remain as string literals. These could theoretically be converted but would require significant effort for minimal benefit since they're static content.

### Future Opportunities

1. **HTMX_RENDER_CONTEXT usage** - The context class exists but wasn't used in this refactoring. It would eliminate the URL-building repetition:
   ```eiffel
   -- Currently:
   l_props_url := "/htmx/properties/" + s8 (a_spec_id) + "/" + s8 (a_screen_id) + "/" + s8 (a_control.id)

   -- With context:
   ctx.properties_url (a_control.id)
   ```

2. **Additional element types** - If more projects use simple_htmx, may need additional elements (nav, header, footer, section, article, etc.)

## Conclusion

The integration validates the library design. Converting manual string building to fluent builders:
- Improved code clarity
- Added type safety
- Reduced potential for typos in HTMX attributes
- Demonstrated library extensibility

The session also proved that AI-created libraries can be immediately useful in real projects, with only minor additions needed to complete coverage.

# After-Action Report #2: Debugging the raw_html Accumulation Bug

**Date:** December 3, 2024
**Session Type:** Bug Fix / TDD Lesson

## Executive Summary

Following the integration, runtime testing revealed that only 1 of 7 controls appeared on the canvas. Root cause: the `raw_html` method in `HTMX_ELEMENT` was **overwriting** content instead of **accumulating** it. This bug and its resolution provide key lessons about TDD and debugging methodology.

## The Bug

### Symptom

Manual testing showed only one control visible on the canvas, despite the spec file containing 7 controls.

### Investigation

1. **System log analysis** revealed all 7 controls WERE being loaded and processed
2. Log showed each control being rendered through the loop
3. But HTML output only contained the last control

### Root Cause

In `htmx_element.e`:

```eiffel
-- BUG: Assignment overwrites previous content
raw_html (a_html: READABLE_STRING_GENERAL): like Current
    do
        content_text := a_html.to_string_32  -- WRONG!
        Result := Current
    end
```

When `render_canvas` looped through controls calling `raw_html` for each, only the last one survived.

### Fix

```eiffel
-- CORRECT: Append accumulates content
raw_html (a_html: READABLE_STRING_GENERAL): like Current
    do
        content_text.append (a_html.to_string_32)  -- Accumulate!
        Result := Current
    end
```

## TDD Lesson Learned

**The mistake:** I fixed the bug FIRST, then wrote tests to verify it.

**The correct approach (TDD):**
1. Write a test that demonstrates the bug (expects accumulation, gets overwrite)
2. Watch the test FAIL
3. Fix the bug
4. Watch the test PASS

**Human feedback:** *"You are SUCH A JR. !!! :-) LOL"*

This is a fundamental TDD principle - the failing test proves:
1. The test actually tests what you think it tests
2. The bug exists as you understand it
3. Your fix actually addresses the bug

Without seeing the test fail first, you can't be certain your test would have caught the bug.

## Using Log Data to Shape Tests

**Key insight from the debugging session:**

The system log showed exactly what data was being processed:
```
[DEBUG] Loading control: title_heading
[DEBUG] Loading control: description_textarea
[DEBUG] Loading control: due_date_picker
...
```

This log data should inform test setup:

```eiffel
test_raw_html_in_loop
        -- Test raw_html in a loop pattern (simulates render_canvas).
    local
        l_row_div: HTMX_DIV
        l_controls: ARRAYED_LIST [STRING]
    do
        -- Setup mirrors what we saw in logs
        create l_controls.make (5)
        l_controls.extend ("<div class=%"control%">Control 1</div>")
        l_controls.extend ("<div class=%"control%">Control 2</div>")
        l_controls.extend ("<div class=%"control%">Control 3</div>")
        l_controls.extend ("<div class=%"control%">Control 4</div>")
        l_controls.extend ("<div class=%"control%">Control 5</div>")

        create l_row_div.make
        across l_controls as l_ctrl loop
            l_row_div.raw_html (l_ctrl).do_nothing
        end

        -- All controls must be present, not just the last
        assert ("has control 1", l_row_div.to_html_8.has_substring ("Control 1"))
        assert ("has control 5", l_row_div.to_html_8.has_substring ("Control 5"))
    end
```

## DBC Priority Reminder

During debugging, the human emphasized DBC priorities:

1. **Class invariants** - Always true for an instance
2. **Loop invariants** - True at start and end of each iteration
3. **Check assertions** - Verify assumptions mid-routine
4. **Preconditions** - What must be true before calling
5. **Postconditions** - What will be true after returning

**Key guidance:** *"Aggressive DBC is better than aggressive logging. Choose DBC before logging, but don't skimp on logging."*

In this case, a postcondition on `raw_html` might have caught the bug:

```eiffel
raw_html (a_html: READABLE_STRING_GENERAL): like Current
    require
        not_empty: not a_html.is_empty
    do
        content_text.append (a_html.to_string_32)
        Result := Current
    ensure
        content_grew: content_text.count >= old content_text.count + a_html.count
    end
```

## Tests Added

Three regression tests were added to `test_htmx_elements.e`:

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `test_raw_html_single_call` | Baseline - single call works |
| `test_raw_html_multiple_calls_accumulate` | Multiple calls accumulate (the bug case) |
| `test_raw_html_in_loop` | Loop pattern matching real-world usage |

## Related Bugs Fixed in Same Session

| Bug | Location | Issue | Fix |
|-----|----------|-------|-----|
| #1 | `is_valid_control_type` | ARRAY.has uses reference equality | Use `across...some` with `~` |
| #2 | `append_attributes` | HASH_TABLE key_for_iteration in across loop | Use `from/until/loop` pattern |
| #3 | `json_to_control` | Only accepting `row`/`col` keys | Accept both `row`/`col` and `grid_row`/`grid_col` |
| #4 | `raw_html` | Assignment overwrites instead of appends | Use `.append()` |

## Documentation Updates

This session resulted in updates to:

| Document | Addition |
|----------|----------|
| `gotchas.md` | HASH_TABLE iteration: `across` vs internal cursor |
| `patterns.md` | Fluent builder content accumulation pattern |
| `simple_htmx/README.md` | Roadmap and Known Issues section |
| `simple_gui_designer/README.md` | Roadmap and Dependencies |
| `simple_ci/config.json` | Added simple_htmx project |

## Conclusion

This debugging session reinforced fundamental software engineering principles:

1. **TDD works:** Write the test first, watch it fail, then fix
2. **Logs inform tests:** Use runtime log data to shape test scenarios
3. **DBC > Logging:** Contracts catch bugs at their source; logs help diagnose after the fact
4. **Fluent interfaces need care:** Content accumulation vs overwrite is a common bug pattern in builders

The bug itself was trivial (`:=` vs `.append()`), but the process of finding it and ensuring it doesn't recur is what distinguishes robust software development.
