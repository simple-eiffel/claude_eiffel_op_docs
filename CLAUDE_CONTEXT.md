# Claude Context File - READ FIRST

**Purpose**: This file provides essential context for Claude at the start of each new conversation. Read this file before writing any Eiffel code.

## Critical Corrections (Compiler-Verified)

### Across Loops
- Status: UNDER INVESTIGATION
- Official docs say `ic.item` accesses elements
- User reports needing to remove `.item` in practice
- **Action**: When writing across loops, be prepared for corrections and document findings

```eiffel
-- Official syntax (may need adjustment):
across my_list as ic loop
    print (ic.item)
end
```

---

## Project Context

- Main repository: `D:\prod\simple_sql`
- SQLite wrapper: `D:\prod\eiffel_sqlite_2025` (v1.0.0, SQLite 3.51.1 with FTS5)
- Reference docs: `D:\prod\reference_docs\`
- User has hands-on Eiffel experience and compiler access
- Trust compiler errors over documentation when conflicts arise
- **Important**: simple_sql depends on eiffel_sqlite_2025 v1.0.0+ for FTS5 and modern SQLite features

## Working Relationship

1. Claude writes code based on current knowledge
2. User compiles and tests
3. Errors are debugged collaboratively
4. Learnings are captured in this reference folder
5. Both benefit in future conversations

## Key Files to Check

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `HATS.md` | Focused work modes - tell Claude which "hat" to wear for specific tasks |
| `gotchas.md` | Known doc-vs-reality conflicts (including EIS annotations) |
| `across_loops.md` | Iteration patterns |
| `scoop.md` | Concurrency patterns |
| `patterns.md` | Verified working code |

## EIS (Eiffel Information System) Quick Reference

When adding documentation to Eiffel classes:
```eiffel
note
    EIS: "name=API Reference", "src=../docs/api/myclass.html", "protocol=URI", "tag=documentation"
```

HTML links back to EiffelStudio:
```html
<a href="eiffel:?class=MY_CLASS&feature=my_feature">View Source</a>
```
